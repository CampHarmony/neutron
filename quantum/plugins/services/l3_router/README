This service plugin implements the L3 routing functionality
(resources router and floatingip) that in Folsom release was
provided by core plugins (openvswitch, linuxbridge, ... etc).

Core plugins can now choose not to implement L3 routing
functionality and instead delegate that to the L3 routing
service plugin.

The required changes to a core plugin are in that case:
- Do not inherit 'l3_db.L3_NAT_db_mixin' anymore.
- Remove "router" from 'supported_extension_aliases'.
- Modify any 'self' references to members in L3_NAT_db_mixin
  to instead use
  'manager.QuantumManager.get_service_plugins().get(constants.L3_ROUTER_NAT)'
  For example,
     self.prevent_l3_port_deletion(...)
  becomes something like
     plugin = manager.QuantumManager.get_service_plugins().get(
         constants.L3_ROUTER_NAT)
     if plugin:
         plugin.prevent_l3_port_deletion(...)
- Do not inherit 'l3_rpc_base.L3RpcCallbackMixin' in
  any '*RpcCallbacks' class.

To use the L3 routing service plugin, please add
'quantum.plugins.services.l3_router.l3_router_plugin.L3RouterPlugin'
to 'service_plugins' in '/etc/quantum/quantum.conf'. I.e.,
service_plugins = quantum.plugins.services.l3_router.l3_router_plugin.L3RouterPlugin
